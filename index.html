                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange
                    markets. The Exchange Rules also apply to Exchange
                    ’Multiples’ product (see the Multiples section below for
                    further details). The Exchange Rules consist of the
                    following:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>

                      The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below – these
                      apply to certain sports and to financial markets); and

                      The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either
                      under the tab entitled "Rules" or under the ‘Rules’).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise
                    in the Market Information or the Specific Sports Rules. If
                    there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules
                    and the General Rules, the Specific Sports Rules shall
                    prevail. If there is any inconsistency between the Market
                    Information and either the General Rules or the Specific
                    Sports Rules, the Market Information shall prevail, except
                    where the General Rules or Specific Sports Rules use the
                    phrase 'regardless of what it says in the Market
                    Information' or similar wording.

                  <h3>2. Market information</h3>
                  <p>
                    The Market Information is provided for information purposes
                    as an at-a-glance guide on how to manage the market. The
                    Market Information may also contain rules on market
                    settlement, however it must always be read in conjunction
                    with the General Rules and the relevant Specific Sports
                    Rules and a link to this Rules and Regulations page will
                    usually be provided in the Market Information for each
                    market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how
                    markets will be managed, regardless of what it says in the
                    Market Information, it reserves the right to suspend any
                    market at any time at its sole discretion, including in
                    order to carry out necessary administration and/or to take
                    any necessary action to protect the customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has
                    been loaded except to correct obvious errors and/or to add
                    wording to clarify the Market Information where appropriate.

                  <h3>3. Customer responsibility</h3>
                  <p>
                    The customers should make themselves aware of all the
                    Exchange Rules affecting any market on which they wish to
                    place a bet. Customers should not simply rely on the Market
                    Information as the Market Information is unlikely to contain
                    all of the applicable rules relating to a market.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By their nature ‘Special Bets’ markets are unpredictable so
                    should be treated with particular caution. Customers are
                    responsible for managing their own positions at all times in
                    such markets. Customers should pay particular attention to
                    the Market Information on ‘Special Bets’ markets to ensure
                    they understand the basis on which the market will be
                    administered and settled.
                  </p>
                  <h3>4. Customer betting disputes &amp; IBAS</h3>
                  <p>
                    Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the
                    Exchange Rules or regarding the settlement of any market
                    should contact.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market
                    has been settled then the customer should provide details of
                    their grievance.

                      and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the official
                      rather than the scheduled ‘off’ time). If the event does
                      not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its
                      reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual
                      'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' as
                      determined will be void.

                      settled, markets will be settled on the official result of
                      the relevant governing body regardless of any subsequent

                      any new information comes into the public domain within 48
                      hours of settlement, then it shall (acting reasonably)

                      Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the
                      event in question. It may settle (or part-settle) some
                      markets before the official result is declared (or may
                      increase a customer's 'available to bet' balance by the
                      minimum potential winnings of that customer on a given
                      market) purely as a customer service benefit. However, it

                      which initially settled the market (for example, a
                      horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing
                      body shortly after a race, but before the result is
                      official); or (ii) if the whole market is eventually
                      voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).

                      stand, run or not" (or something similar) in the Market
                      Information, then all bets on a team or competitor will
                      stand regardless of whether or not the team or competitor
                      starts the event or takes any part in the event.

                      loser providing at least one other team or competitor
                      completes the event. If no team or competitor completes an
                      event (having started) then all bets will be void except
                      for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally

                      It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent

                      or in the Market Information does not participate in the
                      tournament or event then all bets on the market will be
                      void. For example, if there was a "Winner with Federer"
                      tennis market, all bets on the market would be void if
                      Federer did not participate in the tournament. However, if
                      any other competitor did not participate, then bets would
                      stand.

                    <li>
                      A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated
                      if they have taken part to the extent necessary to record
                      an official result or classification (including any

                      decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled
                      completion date. If no official ruling is announced in
                      this 90-day period, then bets on any market relating to
                      this event will be void, except for bets on any markets
                      which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is
                      to be voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to
                      customers, then such part-settled bets will be reversed

                    <li>
                      If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the

                      event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular
                      time period then it will be deemed to have occurred at the
                      end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is
                      scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it
                      will be deemed to have occurred on 45 minutes.

                      local time after the expiry of the specified number of
                      days. For example, if a rugby match is scheduled for the
                      1st of December, then the rule that allows the match to be
                      completed within three days after the scheduled completion
                      date (see Paragraph 3 above) would mean that the deadline
                      for completion of that match would be 23.59:59 on the 4th
                      of December.

                      'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with
                      multiple heats or rounds are determined by the competitor
                      or team which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it
                      takes part in the further round or not) or with the best
                      score, time or finishing position in the final or same
                      heat of that competition or event. If the relevant
                      competitors or teams fail to qualify in the same round of
                      the competition but in different heats then dead-heat
                      rules will apply, irrespective of the finishing positions
                      in their respective heats. Markets will be part-settled
                      after the end of each round and any subsequent
                      disqualifications, penalties or amendments to results or
                      qualifications will not have any effect on the market.
                      Where one or more of the competitors or teams are
                      disqualified, for the purposes of settlement, the
                      disqualified competitor or team will be deemed to have
                      progressed further in the competition or event than all
                      those eliminated from the competition or event prior to
                      the disqualification, and will be deemed to have finished
                      last (or joint last if there is more than one
                      disqualification) of those still competing in the
                      competition or event. Disqualification will be considered
                      to have taken place at the time of the competitor's or
                      team's removal from the competition or event by the
                      relevant governing body, rather than at the time of the

                      However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or

                    <li>
                      Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final"
                      markets) will be determined by the competitor or team that

                  <h3>8. Dead heats</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules
                      and/or the Market Information the Dead Heat Rule applies
                      to bets on a market where there are more winners than
                      expected (as set out in the Market Information).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the
                      stake money is first reduced in proportion by multiplying
                      it by the sum of the number of winners expected (as set
                      out in the Market Information), divided by the number of
                      actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number of
                      winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings
                      are then paid to the successful backers on this 'reduced
                      stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the
                      remaining stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place
                      between three horses. 'Client A' has backed one of the
                      winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and
                      'Client B' has taken the other side of this bet. When the
                      event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 1/3
                      (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the
                      number of actual winners (3)) to calculate the reduced
                      stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200).
                      The backer then receives the traded price matched (4.0)
                      multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this
                      example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus
                      the original 300 stake), and Client B's net losses are
                      100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount
                      paid to the traded price divided by the number of
                      dead-heaters. In the above example, this would be 300 at
                      the traded price of 4.0 (1200) divided by 3; making 400
                      payouts and 100 net winnings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      By way of another example, assume there is an outright
                      winner in a golf tournament but 7 players tie for 2nd
                      place. In the "top 5 finish" market, after settling on the
                      outright winner in the top 5 market there would be 4
                      others designated winner’s places available. 'Client A'
                      has backed one of the winners for 300 at the traded price
                      of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of this
                      bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is
                      multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of expected winners (4)
                      divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to calculate
                      the reduced stake (171.43) and the remainder given to the
                      layer (128.57). The backer then receives the traded price
                      matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43
                      = 685.72). In this example, Client A's net winnings are
                      385.72 (685.72 payout minus the original 300 stake), and
                      Client B's net losses are 385.72.

                      A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is
                      defined as one or more chosen selections in any individual
                      event market.

                    <li>
                      All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules
                      that apply to each individual sport that relates to any
                      leg of any multiple bet.

                      Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back,
                      or where available lay or a mixture of back and lay
                      selections. However, customers cannot have a combination
                      of back and lay selections in any one leg.

                    <li>
                      If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the
                      odds for this leg will be "dutched" which means they will
                      be combined to reflect the chances of any of the
                      selections within the leg winning (if backed) or all of
                      the selections losing (if laid). If customers wish to
                      place a cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than one selection
                      in any event market but not using "dutched" prices) they
                      will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet separately.

                      Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting

                      Multiples product will be broadly based on the relevant
                      singles markets on the Exchange and any such winning
                      multiple bet will be subject to commission as set out in

                      Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP
                      will not be subject to commission, but the odds returned
                      on each leg in such a multiple will be subject to a 5%
                      deduction from the BSP.

                    <li>
                      A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for
                      selections in the multiple to win and a bet on the same
                      selections to place. For example, a £2 each way double
                      represents a £2 bet on both selections to win and a £2 bet
                      on both selections to be placed, with a total stake for
                      the bet of £4. The number of places for each event in each
                      way multiples bet are shown on the multiples win Market
                      Information and do not change. Should the number of
                      runners be equal to or less than the number of places
                      available, the relevant place leg of any multiples bet
                      will be void
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is
                      £2. For example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet combinations)
                      representing a total stake of £2.20 is permitted. However,
                      a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet combinations) representing a total
                      stake of £0.57 or a £1 double (1 bet combination)
                      representing a total stake of £1 will not be permitted.
                      For customers betting in currencies other than English
                      Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an
                      Exchange Multiple bet will not necessarily be the
                      equivalent of £2, though it will be calculated as
                      described in the example above.

                      that are available for Exchange Multiples. Events
                      available for Exchange Multiples will be those listed
                      within any individual Exchange Multiple group (e.g. UK
                      football fixtures for any given day). Not all markets will
                      be available via the Exchange Multiples product.

                      With the exception of the rule directly below, if any
                      selection in any leg is a non-runner or otherwise void
                      under the Exchange Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then
                      all bets on that individual leg will be void and the
                      Exchange Multiple bet shall be adjusted accordingly. For
                      example, a treble including one void leg will become a
                      double. This means that if customers have more than one
                      selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one
                      of those selections is a non-runner, the whole leg will be
                      void. In the event that voided legs mean that an
                      individual bet within a multiple becomes a single bet,
                      then this single bet will stand.

                      Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange
                      Multiples bets struck at BSP, if customers have more than
                      one selection in any leg and one of those selections is a
                      non-runner the leg will stand. For example, if customers
                      back both Desert Orchid and Red Rum in an individual horse
                      race and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will become a
                      back of just Desert Orchid.

                      contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is
                      likely to affect the odds on the outcome of another
                      event). This may happen automatically at the bet placement
                      stage. Alternatively, if such bet is taken in error, it
                      may void the individual bet combinations which include two

                      When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown
                      only give an indicative guide as to the price available
                      for each leg and the overall multiple. Other than Exchange
                      Multiples bets struck at BSP, the price of each leg and
                      the overall multiple price that customers get will be
                      fixed when the multiple bet is actually placed and
                      customers will then be able to see these prices. For more

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange.
                      Exchange SP bets (‘SP bets’) are therefore a type of
                      Exchange bet. The SP is calculated as, by balancing all SP
                      bets and other Exchange bets when the market is suspended
                      at the 'off' of the relevant event. The details of this
                      calculation are provided directly below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be
                      cancelled once it has been placed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each
                      selection being calculated and bets matched when the event
                      starts. The odds are calculated by matching SP backers and
                      other Exchange backers against SP layers and other
                      Exchange layers. The inclusion of other Exchange bets in
                      the SP reconciliation is necessary to ensure that: SP
                      backers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange offers to
                      lay if those offers could increase the SP; and SP layers
                      get the benefit of unmatched Exchange offers to back if
                      those offers could reduce the SP. Including unmatched
                      other Exchange in the SP reconciliation also ensures that
                      the bets of other Exchange backers and layers, which would
                      otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is £10 for a
                      lay bet and £2 for a back bet (or the currency equivalent
                      in each case).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Example 1: on selection A there is £1,000 of backers'
                      stakes and £6,000 of layers' liabilities at SP and there
                      are £500 of unmatched other Exchange back bets available
                      to lay at an average of 5.0. If we ignored the Exchange
                      market in this case the SP would be 7.0. However, this
                      would leave other Exchange back bets, that could also have
                      been matched at their requested price against SP layers,
                      unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be 5.0 and all SP
                      backers and SP layers will be matched at that price. The
                      £500 of Exchange backers' stakes will also be matched at
                      their requested price of 5.0 against the SP layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Example 2: on selection B there are £831 of backers'
                      stakes and £4,428 of layers' liabilities at SP and the
                      following unmatched other Exchange lay bets, available to
                      back: £20 at 6.8, £31.13 at 6.6 and £100 at 6.4. In this
                      case the SP will be 6.68. This is calculated by including
                      the £20 available to back at 6.8 and the £31.13 available
                      to back at 6.6 and balancing those amounts against the SP
                      backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The £100
                      available to back on the Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched
                      as to include any of this amount would lead to an
                      imbalance between SP backers and SP layers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each
                      selection, though it may be displayed in the relevant
                      market view (or in any form/results data) to two decimal
                      places, rounded up or down as applicable. After
                      reconciliation, the full SP on each selection is available
                      by clicking on the relevant individual runner graph.

                    <li>
                      If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an
                      event starts or the SP cannot otherwise be reconciled at
                      the 'off’, it will determine the SP using all available
                      information. For the avoidance of doubt this information
                      will not be limited to betting activity on the relevant
                      market(s). Also in these circumstances, a licensed betting
                      operator within the group may act as risk counterparty to
                      SP bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP. The personnel
                      involved in determining the SP in such circumstances will
                      have no undeclared personal or other interest in the SP in
                      question.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely
                      (for example if a horserace is turned in-play in error),
                      then it will endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so
                      that the SP is determined when the event starts. There may
                      however be circumstances in which this is not possible, in
                      which case the SP will be based on the initial
                      reconciliation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets
                      (including SP limit bets), 'At In-play: Take SP' bets and
                      'At In-play: Keep' bets will all revert to their status
                      before the reconciliation; and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets
                      will either remain cancelled if not matched as part of the
                      reconciliation process, or if matched as part of the
                      reconciliation process, will revert to their unmatched
                      status before the reconciliation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than
                      scheduled (i.e. after the event has started) and
                      determines that a material event has occurred (this will
                      generally mean that the event is not turned in-play), the
                      SP will be determined based solely on SP bets (and ‘At
                      In-play: Take SP’ bets which are unmatched when suspends
                      the relevant market), placed before the 'off'. This means
                      that ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets matched after the off,
                      will be made void and not included in the reconciliation
                      process. In addition, SP bets placed after the 'off' will
                      be voided. However, if the SP reconciliation process is
                      undertaken later than scheduled but determines that no
                      material event has occurred, all bets will stand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be
                      processed as two separate bets: a win bet at SP and a 'to
                      be placed' bet at SP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a
                      market going in-play, then any unmatched bets that have
                      been selected to 'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted
                      to SP bets. Once those bets are converted, they cannot be
                      cancelled.

                  <h4>➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other
                      customers. However, during the reconciliation of the SP,
                      it acts as counterparty in order to balance liabilities
                      between SP bets and other Exchange bets

                  <h4>➢ Placing a SP bet</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives
                      customers two different ways to request an SP bet. These
                      are as follows:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the
                      'Set SP odds limit' box unticked at the top right of the
                      bet manager. For a back bet you are required to enter the
                      stake you wish to bet on the selection. For a lay bet, you
                      are required to enter the liability you are prepared to
                      risk against the selection – in other words the amount
                      that you are prepared to lose, should the selection win
                      (or be placed as applicable).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the
                      'Set SP odds limit' option. Using this you can request a
                      bet at SP conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of
                      a back bet, or maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet.
                      If SP is shorter than the minimum price requested by a
                      backer or is longer than the maximum price requested by a
                      layer, then the relevant bet will lapse when the event
                      starts. If SP is longer than the minimum price requested
                      by a backer or is shorter than the maximum price requested
                      by a layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where an SP
                      is equal to the price limit specified by customers, those
                      bets will be included based on the time they were
                      submitted, on a first come, first served basis as is the
                      existing convention for other Exchange bets. This means
                      that such bets may be unmatched or partially matched.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from
                      the relevant market until after the completion of the
                      event, the application to all bets matched at or before
                      the "off" (including SP bets) of any reduction factor, may
                      mean that the matched price for an SP back bet with an
                      odds limit requested, is adjusted to a price below the
                      lower limit requested. It may also mean that an SP lay bet
                      request with maximum odds requested, may not be matched
                      even though the odds on the selection, after any post-race
                      adjustment for the late non-runner, is below the maximum
                      odds requested.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the
                      minimum/maximum odds requested can be shortened in the
                      case of a back bet or a lengthened in the case of a lay
                      bet at any time before the event starts. However, as
                      mentioned above, an SP bet request cannot actually be
                      cancelled by a customer once it has been placed. Details
                      of the impact of non-runners on the SP re provided below.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4>➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of
                      your selection from the market view (as opposed to
                      clicking on the 'SP' of your selection). When such an
                      Exchange bet is fully or partially unmatched it can be
                      adjusted and cancelled in the normal course. Previously,
                      unmatched bets were automatically cancelled when a market
                      was suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event. You can
                      now choose to either have your unmatched Exchange bet
                      convert to an SP bet when the market suspends at the start
                      of the event, or to have the bet 'persist' when the event
                      goes in-play (see the 'keep' option below).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP
                      bet when the market suspends you should select the 'At
                      In-Play: Take SP' option in the bet manager. If there is a
                      non-runner in a win market with a reduction factor of at
                      least 2.5%, or a non-runner in a place market with a
                      reduction factor of at least 4%, it is policy to cancel
                      unmatched lay bets on all other runners in the market. In
                      the case of any such non-runner, instead of being
                      cancelled a lay bet for which the 'At In-Play: Take SP'
                      option has been selected, will automatically convert to an
                      SP bet. After this conversion, the bet cannot be
                      cancelled. Otherwise, unlike an SP bet, you can choose to

                      you have chosen for the bet to persist or to convert to an

                      If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to
                      an SP bet, the liability of your Exchange lay bet will be
                      converted into a liability for the SP bet. Your liability
                      for that SP bet will never be more than the liability for
                      the Exchange bet you had specified. However, the amount
                      you can win on the SP lay bet may differ from the amount
                      you would have won had the Exchange bet been matched,
                      depending on the final SP.

                  <h4>➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake
                      or the odds requested by a customer, despite any
                      non-runners or withdrawals. However, customers who have
                      selected the SP limit option can reduce the minimum SP
                      odds they are prepared to accept on a selection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a
                      customer's liability based on the reduction factor(s) of
                      any non-runner(s) and the reduction factor of the runner
                      on which the customer's bet has been placed. This is to
                      ensure that the balance between the backers' stakes and
                      the layers' liability reflects the revised market after
                      the runner has been removed. For example, if a horse with
                      a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner, then another
                      horse in the same market priced at about 5 (i.e. a
                      reduction factor of 20%) will change to a price of about
                      2.5. Therefore, the liability on a £200 lay bet on that
                      runner will need to change to a liability of about £75 to
                      ensure that a balancing back bet will have the same £50
                      stake. This is done by multiplying the liability by 37.5%
                      (i.e. 100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds
                      limit specified, this limit will be reduced by the
                      reduction factor of any non-runner, if the non-runner has
                      a reduction factor of at least 2.5%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a
                      customer's liability based on the reduction factor(s) of
                      any non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly
                      different, in line with the application of place market
                      reduction factors. The liability will be reduced by the
                      reduction factor of the removed runner. Where the lay bet
                      on a place market has a maximum odds limit specified, the
                      potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the odds – 1) will be
                      reduced by the reduction factor of the removed runner.

                      Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds

                      reduction factor of any non-runner.

                    <li>
                      For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the
                      'off', a customer can request that an unmatched Exchange
                      bet should not be cancelled when the market is turned
                      in-play. This is done by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep'
                      option in the bet manager (and confirming that request)
                      and means that the unmatched bet persists when other
                      unmatched bets are cancelled at the start of the event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a
                      horseracing market (apart for late withdrawals as
                      described in the next bullet point below), it is policy to
                      cancel unmatched offers to lay all other horses in the
                      market if the non-runner has a reduction factor of 2.5% or
                      greater for win markets, or 4.0% or greater for place
                      markets. In these circumstances offers to lay a horse with
                      the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will not be
                      cancelled. Instead the lay odds offered in place markets
                      will be reduced in proportion with the reduction factors
                      of any non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win
                      markets providing the relevant non-runner has a reduction
                      factor of at least 2.5%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to
                      remove the non-runner from the market before turning it
                      in-play. In such cases if can determine that the late
                      withdrawal is a material runner (i.e. a selection with a
                      reduction factor of approx. 20% or greater in the win
                      market), it reserves the right to cancel ALL lay 'keep'
                      bets (in both the win and ‘to be placed’ markets) before
                      turning the market in-play. If it does not cancel lay
                      'keep' bets in the case of a late withdrawal (for example,
                      it may not be possible to know which horse is withdrawn,
                      at the time of the off), any such bets placed before the
                      off and matched in-play will remain at the original
                      selected price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will
                      not be subject to any reduction factor which as a result
                      of the late withdrawal, will be applied after the
                      completion of the race to bets matched at or before the
                      'off'.

                    <li>
                      Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to
                      cancel 'keep' bets to protect customers but, unless
                      stipulated in the market rules or the market information,
                      the general principle is that at no point will a 'keep'
                      bet be cancelled by unless it remains unmatched when the
                      market is closed (for the final time) at the end of the
                      event.

                    <li>
                      For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example)
                      when a Material Event occurs in a soccer match and other
                      unmatched bets are cancelled before the market is
                      reopened, a keep bet will not be cancelled.

                      number for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds
                      involved in the dead heat will be multiplied by each other

                      If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or

                      greyhounds involved in the dead heat will be added up and
                      divided by the number of greyhounds involved in the dead
                      heat and the resulting number will be multiplied by itself
                      to give the applicable multi-trap number (even if not a
                      round number). By way of example: traps 1, 3 and 6 dead
                      heat for first. Add these numbers up gives 10; divide this
                      number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (3)
                      which gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by

                      If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or

                      greyhounds involved in the dead heat will be added up and
                      divided by the number of greyhounds involved in the dead
                      heat and the resulting number will be multiplied by the
                      number of the winner to give the applicable multi-trap
                      number (even if not a round number). By way of example:
                      trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6 dead heat for second. Adding
                      the numbers of the dead heating runners up gives 9; divide
                      this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat
                      (2) which gives a resulting number of 4.5; multiple 4.5 by
                      the winning number (1) to give 4.5.

                      For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all

                    <li>
                      If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use
                      the available information to determine the time of the

                      whether the horse was a 'material runner' in the market.
                      It will undertake a similar determination in cases where
                      it is advised through official channels that a runner has
                      been formally scratched from an ante-post race. In
                      determining whether a horse is a material runner, it will
                      consider the general price of the horse immediately before
                      the horse's death (or immediately before being advised it
                      has been scratched), in the market and in the wider
                      betting market. Broadly, it will consider a horse to be a
                      material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate
                      chance of winning of 8-10 per cent or better.

                      factor allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the

                      When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction

                      a percentage. These reduction factors may be updated
                      periodically at the discretion based on trading in the
                      market, but after approximately 15 minutes (approximately
                      5 minutes for Australian and US markets) from the
                      scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will be updated

                      have a different reduction factor for each market.

                    <li>
                      All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse

                    <li>
                      In the win market: if the reduction factor of the
                      non-runner is 2.5% or greater, the traded price of all the
                      matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by an
                      amount equal to the non-runner's final reduction factor
                      and all the unmatched offers to lay will be cancelled. If
                      the non-runner's reduction factor is less than 2.5%,
                      reductions will not be applied and unmatched bets will not
                      be cancelled.

                    <li>
                      In the place market, the reduction factor of all
                      non-runners will be applied (even if less than 2.5%) and
                      the potential winnings in relation to matched bets on the
                      remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                      non-runner's final reduction factor. Only if the
                      non-runner's reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all

                      Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck
                      in-play. However, if a market is turned in-play
                      prematurely by error (or, for example, there is a false
                      start), all bets matched during this time will be subject
                      to any later reduction factor, provided the market is
                      turned out of play before the race commences. In the event
                      of a late withdrawal, it reserves the right to remove the
                      runner after completion of the race. In this case only
                      those bets matched prior to the off will be affected by a
                      reduction factor.

                    <li>
                      In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in
                      error or following incorrect information regarding a
                      runner’s participation, it will reinstate both the runner
                      and all previously matched bets associated with that
                      runner. All bets made between the time of withdrawal and
                      reinstatement will be void in both the place market and
                      the win market. The reduction factor applied to matched
                      bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the
                      original prices will become valid.

                    <li>
                      Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets
                      in the order in which they are brought to attention. If It
                      becomes aware of more than one non-runner at the same
                      time, it will remove the non-runners from the relevant

                    <li>
                      If a runner is not included in a market because of an
                      error or because of incorrect information regarding a
                      runner’s participation, It reserve the right to introduce
                      the missing runner into the market at any time prior to
                      settlement (even after the race has been run), provided
                      that It has determined that the missing runner is not a
                      material runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor
                      of approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such
                      circumstances, all pre-play unmatched and matched bets
                      will stand, however if the runner is not introduced before
                      the start of the race, all in-play bets will be void.
                      However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a material
                      runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new
                      market will be loaded where possible.

                  <h4>➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded
                      price.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is
                      25% the traded price on all previously matched bets on
                      other horses will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0
                      would become 6.0 etc. And these might be further reduced
                      if another horse is subsequently declared a non-runner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded
                      win price. The advertised place terms will then apply to
                      the revised win prices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is
                      25% the traded price on all previously matched bets on
                      other horses will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of
                      8.0 would become 6.0. If each Way terms were 1/5th odds
                      for 3 places, the corresponding price for the Place
                      portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the place market, reductions will be made to the
                      potential winnings on the bet only, and not the traded
                      price.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is
                      25% the potential winnings on all previously matched bets
                      on the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded
                      price of 8.0 would become 6.25. For example, a £10 bet on
                      a horse to be placed at a traded price of 8.0 would
                      provide winnings of £70. If there is a non-runner with a
                      reduction factor of 25% in the race, that factor will be
                      applied to the £70 of potential winnings leaving potential
                      winnings of £52.50. Therefore, the revised traded price
                      will be 6.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The traded price may be further reduced if any other
                      horse(s) is subsequently declared a non-runner, however
                      odds cannot be reduced below 1.01.

                    <li>
                      Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant
                      markets but will have a non-applicable reduction factor
                      until It has received confirmation that it is a confirmed

                      For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor
                      applicable to a non-runner replaced by a reserve, will be
                      applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior
                      to the removal from those markets of such non-runner.
                      Likewise, should a reserve runner become a confirmed
                      runner but subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction
                      factor applicable to such non-runner will be applied to
                      all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the

                      all bets will be void unless an official result is
                      declared by the applicable governing body. Where an
                      official result has been declared by the official
                      governing body, that official result will govern match and
                      handicap market settlement but all other markets will be
                      void unless their result has already been determined at
                      the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of
                      abandonment, it would not have been possible for the
                      outcome of the bet to change had the match continued to
                      its natural conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points
                      have been scored at the time a match is abandoned: (i) a
                      bet placed on 35 points or more to be scored would be
                      settled as a winning bet, (ii) a bet placed on 30-35
                      points to be scored would be settled as a losing bet and
                      (iii) a bet placed on 40-45 points to be scored would be
                      void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer /
                      team to score last / team to score last try / last scoring
                      play would all be void.

                      the clock hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each

                      subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result.

                    <li>
                      If there is no presentation ceremony, outcomes will be
                      determined in accordance with the official result of the
                      relevant governing body, regardless of any subsequent
                      disqualification or amendment to the result (except if an
                      amendment is announced within 24 hours of the initial
                      settlement of the relevant market in order to correct an
                      error in reporting the result).

                    <li>
                      Unless stated otherwise in the Market Information, if an
                      event is abandoned, postponed or cancelled, all bets will
                      be void unless (a) the event is completed at the same
                      venue within 7 days of the official scheduled completion
                      date; or (b) a result is 'called' by the relevant
                      governing body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The General Rules will apply for 'match bets'. However, in
                      respect of "Nordic Combined" if all competitors involved
                      in the match bet do not start both sections of the event
                      (ski jumping and cross country) then bets will be void.

                    least one letter, one number and one special character and

                    do so shall be at your sole risk and expense. You must log
                    out of the Service at the end of each session. If you

                    a third party, or your Account has been hacked into, or your
                    password has been discovered by a third party, you must

                    hacked into, we may, however, require you to provide
                    additional information/ documentation so that we can verify
                    your identity. We will immediately suspend your Account once
                    we are aware of such an incident. In the meantime you are
                    responsible for all activity on your Account including third
                    party access, regardless of whether or not their access was

                  <p>
                    In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or
                    processes, all bets are rendered void. You are under an
                    obligation to inform us immediately as soon as you become
                    aware of any error with the service. In the event of
                    communication or system errors or bugs or viruses occurring
                    in connection with the service and/or payments made to you
                    as a result of a defect or effort in the Service, we will
                    not be liable to you or to any third party for any direct or
                    indirect costs, expenses, losses or claims arising or
                    resulting from such errors, and we reserve the right to void
                    all games/bets in question and take any other action to
                    correct such errors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the event of a casino system malfunction, or
                    disconnection issues, all bets are rendered void. In the
                    event of such error or any system failure or game error that
                    results in an error in any odds calculation, charges, fees,
                    rake, bonuses or payout, or any currency conversion as
                    applicable, or other casino system malfunction (the “Casino
                    Error”), we reserve the right to declare null and void any
                    wagers or bets that were the subject of such Casino Error
                    and to take any money from your Account relating to the
                    relevant bets or wagers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in
                    posting lines. However, if as a result of human error or
                    system problems a bet is accepted at an odd that is:
                    materially different from those available in the general
                    market at the time the bet was made; or clearly incorrect
                    given the chance of the event occurring at the time the bet
                    was made then we reserve the right to cancel or void that
                    wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event has
                    started.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid
                    and to adjust your account to rectify any mistake. An
                    example of such a mistake might be where a price is
                    incorrect or where we enter a result of an event
                    incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds in your
                    Account, we may demand that you pay us the relevant
                    outstanding amount relating to any erroneous bets or wagers.
                    Accordingly, we reserve the right to cancel, reduce or
                    delete any pending plays, whether placed with funds
                    resulting from the error or not.

                  <p>10. <u>General Rules</u></p>
                  <p>
                    If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then
                    the general rule will not apply.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the
                    event’s settlement; we do not recognise protested or
                    overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an
                    event suspended after the start of competition will be
                    decided according to the wagering rules specified for that
                    sport by us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no
                    queries will be entertained after that period of time.
                    Within 72 hours after results are posted, the company will
                    only reset/correct the results due to human error, system
                    error or mistakes made by the referring results source.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events
                    will be determined by us and are subject to change without
                    prior written notice. We also reserve the right to adjust
                    limits on individual Accounts as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Customers are solely responsible for their own account
                    transactions. Please be sure to review your wagers for any
                    mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction is
                    complete, it cannot be changed. We do not take
                    responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers made by the
                    Customer and will not entertain discrepancy requests because
                    a play is missing or duplicated. Customers may review their
                    transactions in the My Account section of the site after
                    each session to ensure all requested wagers were accepted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a
                    Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter and compete in
                    the event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home
                    and away teams by indicating the home and away team by means
                    of vertical placement on the desktop site version. This
                    means in American Sports we would place the home team on the
                    bottom. For Non-US sports, we would indicate the home team
                    on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we attempt to
                    include the letter “N” next to the team names to indicate
                    this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not
                    distinguish between European and American Sports. On the
                    Asian and mobile versions of the site, the home team is
                    always listed first. However, we do not guarantee the
                    accuracy of this information and unless there is an official
                    venue change subsequent to bets being placed, all wagers
                    have action.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A game/match will have action regardless of the League
                    heading that is associated with the matchup. For example,
                    two teams from the same League are playing in a Cup
                    competition. If the matchup is mistakenly placed in the
                    League offering, the game/match will still have action, as
                    long as the matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup
                    will have action as long as the two teams are correct, and
                    regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our
                    Website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If an event is not played on the same date as announced by
                    the governing body, then all wagers on the event have no
                    action. If an event is posted by us, with an incorrect date,
                    all wagers have action based on the date announced by the
                    governing body.

                    below the age of majority as stipulated in the laws of the
                    jurisdiction applicable to you) when you placed any bets
                    through the service your account will be suspended to
                    prevent you placing any further bets or making any
                    withdrawals from your account. We will then investigate the
                    matter, including whether you have been betting as an agent
                    for, or otherwise on behalf, of a person under 18 years (or
                    below the age of majority as stipulated in the laws of the

                    This condition also applies to you if you are over the age
                    of 18 years but you are placing your bets within a
                    jurisdiction which specifies a higher age than 18 years for

                  <p>
                    To maintain the highest level of security, we require all
                    our members to provide us with certain documentation in
                    order to validate their accounts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please note that the identification procedures shall be done
                    before a cardholder starts operating and using services of
                    our merchants.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Why do I need to provide documentation?</h3>
                  <p>There are several reasons:</p>
                  <p>
                    We are committed to providing a socially responsible
                    platform for online gaming. All of our members must be 18 or
                    older and we are bound by our licensing agreement to verify
                    this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in
                    our interests to guarantee maximum security on all
                    transactions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies
                    are in line with international banking standards. A proven
                    business relationship with each and every member is
                    mandatory for the protection of all parties. Our licensing
                    agreement also obliges us to comply with this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Finally, by ensuring that your account details are
                    absolutely correct, the inconvenience of 'missing payments'
                    can be avoided. It can take weeks (and sometimes months) to
                    trace, recall and resend using the correct information. This
                    lengthy process also results in additional fees from our
                    processors.
                  </p>

                  <h3>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PROVIDE?</h3>
                  <p>PROOF OF ID:</p>
                  <p>
                    A color copy of a valid government issued form of ID
                    (Driver's License, Passport, State ID or Military ID)
                  </p>

                  <h3>PROOF OF ADDRESS:</h3>
                  <p>A copy of a recent utility bill showing your address</p>
                  <p>
                    Note: If your government Id shows your address, you do not
                    need to provide further proof of address.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additional documentation might be required depending on the
                    withdrawal method you choose
                  </p>

                  <h3>When do I need to provide these documents?</h3>
                  <p>
                    We greatly appreciate your cooperation in providing these at
                    your earliest possible convenience to avoid any delays in
                    processing your transactions. We must be in receipt of the
                    documents before any cash transactions can be sent back to
                    you. Under special circumstances we may require the
                    documents before further activity (deposits and wagering)
                    can take place on your account
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please understand, if we do not have the required documents
                    on file, your pending withdrawals will be cancelled and
                    credited back to your account. You will be notified when
                    this happens via the notification system.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How can I send you these documents?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Please scan your documents, or take a high quality digital
                    camera picture, save the images as jpegs, then upload the
                    files using our secure form

                    >.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How do I know my documents are safe with you?</h3>
                  <p>
                    The security of your documentation is of paramount
                    importance. All files are protected with the highest level
                    of encryption at every step of the review process. All
                    documentation received is treated with the utmost respect
                    and confidentiality.
                  </p>

                    Sky247io is committed to endorsing responsible wagering
                    among its customers as well as promoting the awareness of
                    problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and

                  <p>
                    Sky247io’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its
                    commitment to minimizing the negative effects of problem
                    gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.

                    Sky247io supports the generation of online gamblers offering
                    them a wide range of games and entertainment. We also take
                    responsibility for our product line-up.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The aim of Sky247io is to provide the world’s safest and
                    most innovative gaming platform for adults. The offered
                    clear and safe products allow each user to play within his
                    financial means and to receive the highest quality service.
                    Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding
                    principles of Sky247io’s work. It is therefore clear that
                    Sky247io should do its best to avoid and reduce the
                    problems, which can arise from participation in gambling,
                    particularly in cases of immoderate playing. At the same
                    time it is important to respect the rights of those who take
                    part in games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of
                    entertainment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Responsible Gaming at Sky247io is based on three fundamental
                    principles: Security of the player, Security of the game and
                    Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research
                    institutes, associations and therapy institutions, we work
                    on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable framework
                    for online gaming.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Player security</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    We take responsibility for the security of our players.
                    Protection of the players is based on forbidding the
                    attendance of the minors from participation in games and the
                    protection of privacy, which involves responsible processing
                    of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random
                    nature of the products offered are monitored closely by
                    independent organizations. Marketing communication is also
                    geared towards player protection: we promise only what
                    players can receive in our transparent line.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and
                    other gaming offers play in moderation for entertainment.
                    Certain habits and behavior patterns (such as shopping,
                    playing sports, eating or consumption of alcohol) which are
                    considered to be normal and not causing any concern can
                    develop into addiction for some people and cause problems.
                    In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can lead to
                    problems for a small group of customers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further
                    participation in the gaming line-up. Subsequently the
                    customers are provided with contacts of organizations where
                    they can receive professional advice and support.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The basic principle promoted by Sky247io is that the final
                    decision and responsibility on whether to play or not, and
                    how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by
                    the customer himself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most
                    effective form of protection from addiction. Sky247io sees
                    its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing
                    transparent products, full information and keeping a clear
                    line of conduct.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>Protection of minors</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Sky247io does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18)
                    to participate in games and make bets. That’s why the
                    confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the
                    confirmation of date of birth are mandatory requirements
                    during registration. Sky247io considers the issue of minors

                  <p><strong>Get informed with the main issues!</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in
                    games within their financial capacity is fully acceptable.
                    However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a
                    form of entertainment, it is a challenge that must be
                    considered seriously.

                  <p><strong>What is the problematic game behavior?</strong></p>
                  <p>
                    A problematic game behavior is considered to be such
                    behavior, which interferes mode of life, work, financial
                    position or health of a person or his family. Long
                    participation in games is counter indicative to such person
                    as it can lead to negative consequences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially
                    recognized and enlisted in the list of psychological
                    diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and
                    ICD-10. It is defined as long, repeating and frequently
                    amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing
                    negative personal and social circumstances, such as a debt,
                    rupture of family relations and delay of professional
                    growth.

                    It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game
                    dependence can be qualified only by experts. The material
                    presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and
                    define your own game behaviour.

                    The special hazard of addictions that are not associated
                    with any substance is that it is very difficult to define
                    the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there
                    are some diagnostic signals that may point out the existing
                    problems. In the presence of at least five of the following
                    symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:
